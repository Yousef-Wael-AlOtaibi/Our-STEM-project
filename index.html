                <p>We were brainstorming about what we should make for our STEM project, and nothing felt more compelling and endorsing other than engineering an air condtioner or as some may call it, an A/C</p>
                <p>We were trying to visualize the air conditioner in our heads, and we finally came to a plan.
                We were going to use a cardboard box to hold the main components inside it, a fan, a motor, a 9v battery, a water bottle with ice inside it, and finally a few paper cups to take air in and push it out.

                <button id="remove-steps-btn" class="remove-btn">X</button>
                <p>We planned and followed the following steps from scratch to finally come out with our complete project today (psst... you can copy but dont make it obvious.):</p>
                <ul id="steps-list">
                    <li id="first"><p>1: make sure the structure is good enough to withstand the weight of the parts </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        2: make 2 holes in the box for sucking the air and blowing it out.</p></li>
                    <li><p>3: stick the motor to the ceiling of the box.</p></li>
                       <li><p>4: make another hole for the on / off switch.</p></li>
                    <li><p>5: connect the battery , motor , and switch to each other to make a closed circuit. </p></li>
                    <li><p>6: get a paper cup and make small holes in by using skewer sticks and then stick it to the hole that sucks the air into the box </p></li>
                    <li><p>7: make sure that the box looks friendly and good enough from the outside </p></li>
                    <li><p>8: try turning on it on , if it works that means you did all the steps correctly, if it doesn’t work that means that you did some steps wrong and will have to revise what you did.</p></li>
                </ul>
